# OpenAPI

## Generate OpenAPI specification

The OpenAPI spec for the `kms` service can be generated by running the following `make` target from the project root directory:

```sh
$ make generate-openapi-spec
```

The generated spec can be found under `.build/rest/openapi/spec/openAPI.yml`.

## Run OpenAPI demo

Start the OpenAPI demo by running the following `make` target:

```sh
$ make run-openapi-demo
```

Once the services are up, click [here](http://localhost:8089/openapi/) to launch the OpenAPI interface.
